# Alex Kang

Hey, I'm Alex, and I'm actively looking for a new career opportunity in software development. I am passionate in making fun random projects that interest me, and I love the process of learning from developing them.

To tell a little about myself, I am currently a Computer Science major at Brigham Young University, with an anticipated graduation date of April 2024. I loved learning here, especially learning how the academic knowledge applies to real-world applications in software development.

I am currently working as a Web Developer at the Center For Teaching And Learning. I am currently working on the instructor version of BYU's "Learning Suite" Learning Management System.

Feel free to checkout some of my projects.
